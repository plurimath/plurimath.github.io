== Why UnicodeMath?

**Plurimath**, a versatile tool for mathematical representation, has been addressing these challenges by providing conversion capabilities between different markup languages. In a recent development, **Plurimath** has integrated **UnicodeMath** support, further enhancing its capabilities and opening up new possibilities for mathematical expression representation.

**UnicodeMath**, known for its unrestricted support of symbols and scenarios, brings a new level of flexibility to **Plurimath**. With **UnicodeMath** support, users can now express complex mathematical concepts using a wider range of symbols and notations, without being constrained by the limitations of traditional markup languages.
