  Easily parse scientific units of measure with the recently added support of **UnitsML** in **Plurimath**.

= UnitsML

== Introduction

**Plurimath** has recently integrated **UnitsML**, empowering users with enhanced capabilities to process scientific units of measurement. This enhancement reflects **Plurimath**'s commitment to adapting to the evolving needs of users in mathematics and science.

== Using UnitsML

There is no direct processing like other languages,

`Plurimath::Math.parse(string, :<language>) # => NOT SUPPORTED FOR UNITSML`

The input of **UnitsML** is restricted to a specific syntax inside of an **AsciiMath** string. See the syntax below,

[source,ruby]
----
  string = '<optional asciimath string>"unitsml(<unitsml string>)"<optional asciimath string>'
  fomrula = Plurimath::Math.parse(string, :asciimath)
----

The output syntax will not be the same as the input, see the example below.

[source,ruby]
----
  string = '1 "unitsml(kg)"'
  formula = Plurimath::Math.parse(string, :asciimath)
  formula.to_asciimath # => '1 rm(kg)'
----

NOTE: In **AsciiMath** strings, **UnitsML** input must be enclosed within double quotes for clarity and specificity.
